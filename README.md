# I Wuz Here

## The Concept
Remember going to that hip, trendy restaurant? Or that straight up tourist trap?
You have fun; you enjoy the experience, until one thing catches your eye...
**A Message Board**.
On it, Janet from California wrote: "Drove 2 whole days just to be here!", and
Sandy from Brooklyn simply notes: "Iconic." It was a bit tacky, sure, but it
was *part of the experience*. But let's face it... a cork board with post it 
notes is a bit obsolete. So we made one to suit the 21st century.

## The Website
A sleek, minimalistic design, seemlessly integrated with the intuitive Google Maps 
API, *I Wuz Here* is the perfect place to have the world's message boards.

There are 2 main functions, both requiring you, the user, to help us attain this 
monumental task. Firstly, users are given the ability to add markers (representing 
significant locations), giving them a unique name and description. These markers 
will then be added to every user's map on the site. This will then allow users at 
this location to conduct the second function, which is adding the "posts" that
we all know and love. Enjoy!
